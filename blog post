            <h2>The Process of Creating Comic Book Illustrations</h2>
            <p>
                Creating a comic book is a collaborative process that involves several steps. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the typical workflow:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Concept Development:</strong> The first step is to develop the concept for your comic. This includes outlining the story, defining the characters, and deciding on the overall tone and style.</li>
                <li><strong>Script Writing:</strong> Once the concept is solidified, the next step is to write the script. This includes the dialogue, narration, and descriptions of each scene and panel.</li>
                <li><strong>Storyboarding:</strong> The artist will create rough sketches or storyboards to map out the layout of the comic. This helps to plan the pacing and composition of each page.</li>
                <li><strong>Pencil Art:</strong> After the storyboard is approved, the artist will begin working on the detailed pencil art, refining the sketches into fully realized illustrations.</li>
                <li><strong>Inking:</strong> Inking involves going over the pencil art with ink to add depth, contrast, and definition to the illustrations.</li>
                <li><strong>Coloring:</strong> If the comic is in color, the artist will add color to the illustrations, enhancing the mood and atmosphere of the scenes.</li>
                <li><strong>Lettering:</strong> The final step is adding the text to the comic, including dialogue, captions, and sound effects. This is done in a way that complements the artwork and enhances the readability of the comic.</li>
